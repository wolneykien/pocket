	* debian.pocket (0.2.24.1)

	  * Fix: added depends for dpkg-dev there dpkg-architecture lives
		* Fix: attempting to cleanup of not existing chroot
	  * Fix: wrong syntax in checkchroot target
		+ Improve: added ability to specify additional
		           packages neeeded for cross building in
							 repository config file
	  * Fix: on debian stretch and above crossbuild-essential 
		       has no depedency for libc6-dev (added this package to repo config)
		* Improve: now all packages copyed to internal repo

	   * Fix: mk-build-deps is very old tool and worked totaly meangfull with -A
	          Using of this argument disabled now.
	   * Note: mk-build-deps not supporting Build-*-Arch fields
	           I thing it must be replaced in the future. [san]

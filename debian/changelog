pocket (0.2.19-1) experimental; urgency=low

    * Improve:  separate chroots for different distributions

                now pocket maintenance separate:

                  1) build roots
                  2) repos
                  3) install-roots

                for differrent  distribution (such as jessie, stretch) in one
                pocket directory 

    * Improve:  added checking of current build root system
                for native arch & distribution missmatch.
                If missmatch with required for build parameters (arch & distribution)
                detected then chroot cleared and initialized automaticaly

  	* Improve:  added pocket-build script with option syntax similar	
  	            to dpkg-buildpackage command but with exentions

           of build. But you can disable update manualy passing UPDATE=no
           variable to pocket
    * Improve: checks debian version before using mk-build-deps --host-arch
               option. Used only on stretch and above. 
  	* Improve: automaticaly unapply all patches during orig.tar.xz creation
               (quilt added to build system packages set)

           to pass Debian rules for package version sttring [san]

          package version string during creating of

   * Improve: added ability to upgrade packages before builf 
              UPGRADE=yes/no variable for build target
              as default no upgrade performed

          Using of this argument disabled now.
   * Note: mk-build-deps not supporting Build-*-Arch fields
           I thing it must be replaced in the future. [san]

   * Fix: 'filecheck' target - wrong directory path specified
   * Fix: describe internal repo URL as copy:// instead of file://
          to prevent apt-get create symlinks. Symlinks not possible because

          Also call "apt-get -y autoremove" to deinstall 
          all (previously installed) dependencies

  *  Fix: mark rebuildpkg and build target dependencies as order depedencies
